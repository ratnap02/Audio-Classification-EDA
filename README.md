#This project is an Audio Classification task, which involves analyzing audio files to classify them into different categories based on their features. In this case, the dataset being used is UrbanSound8K, which contains audio samples of different urban sounds like dog barks, car horns, sirens, and more.

#Key Aspects of the Project:
 #1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA is conducted to understand the distribution of the data, check for imbalances in the classes (e.g., some sounds like street music and dog barks have more samples than others like gun shots or car horns).
This step ensures that the dataset is well-understood before feeding it into a machine learning model.
Data Preprocessing using MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients):

MFCCs are features extracted from audio that represent the frequency content over time. They are crucial for understanding audio signals and are widely used in speech and sound classification tasks.
In the project, you use librosa, a Python library for audio processing, to load the audio files and extract features such as the waveform and sample rate.
Visualization of Audio Files:

Waveform Plots: Visualizes the amplitude of the sound over time to see how the audio behaves.
For example, you plot the waveform of different audio files, like "dog_bark.wav," to analyze the sound pattern.
Feature Extraction:

Audio data is processed and converted into numerical arrays that capture the frequency and amplitude of the audio signals. This is a crucial step in preparing the data for classification.
Classification Task:

Once the features are extracted, the goal is to classify the sounds into predefined categories (e.g., dog bark, street music, car horn).
This can be done using machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or deep learning models.
Balancing the Dataset:

A check is done to see if the dataset is imbalanced, which means some classes (sounds) have more samples than others. This is an important step because imbalanced data can lead to biased models.
